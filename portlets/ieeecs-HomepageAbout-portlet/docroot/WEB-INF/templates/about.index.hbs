            The Computer Society Digital Library is well known for being the most comprehensive
            computing resource in the world. But sometimes, you might not need access to the
            entire computing universe.

            That&rsquo;s why IEEE Computer Society is pleased to introduce CSDL Bundled Article Sales.
            Now, your company or organization can purchase access to only as many articles as you
            need-whether that&rsquo;s 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500.
            <br /><br />
            And you can select just the topics you&rsquo;re interested in including areas such as cloud, big
            data, mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), embedded systems.
            <br /><br />
            CSDL Bundled Articles offer a cost-effective way of accessing one of the world&rsquo;s greatest
            computing resources. And if you find that your allotment is running out-don&rsquo;t worry;
            we will remind you when it&rsquo;s time to reorder.
